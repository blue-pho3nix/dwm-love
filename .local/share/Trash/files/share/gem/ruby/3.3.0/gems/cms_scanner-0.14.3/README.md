The goal of this gem is to provide a quick and easy way to create a CMS/WebSite Scanner by acting like a Framework and providing classes, formatters etc.

## /!\ This gem is currently Experimental /!\

## A basic implementation example is available in the example folder.

To start to play with it, copy all its files and folders into a new git repository and run `bundle install && rake install` inside it.
It will create a `cmsscan` command that you can run against a target, ie `cmsscan --url https://www.google.com`


Install Dependencies: `bundle install`
