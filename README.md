# Kali DWM Love

I made scripts to install various DWM themes on Kali. <br>
These scripts are based on https://larbs.xyz/larbs.sh <br>

Note: I use VMware. The `.xprofile` file has settings that make copy paste possible in DWM.<br> 
If you're using Virtualbox, you can remove `vmware-user` from `.xprofile`.

Enjoy! <3 <br>

## Kali DWM Installation Instructions:
1. Pick a theme
2. Goto the theme's folder for install instructions

## Themes:
